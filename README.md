# Skype for Business Tools

This project is a collection of SKype for Business related scripts. Not all of the scripts contained are exclusively for Skype for Business but are related to a dependent service (such as AD, load balancers, generic server configurations, etc). 

## Uses

While some of the tools, examples, and code snippets are may be within a production environment -- that is not the primary purpose of this project. This is mostly just meant to be things that I find interesting within the SfB realm. It a side-effect is that the tools are useful to someone, then that's great!
